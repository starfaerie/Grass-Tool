## Grass Placement Tool

A GPU-based real-time grass placement tool for Unity by [Astrid Wilde](http://twitter.com/astridwilde1).
Currently only works in Unity's Standard Rendering Pipeline (support for LWRP, URP, and HDRP may be added at a later date)

This grass tool will allow environmental artists to procedurally add grass geometry to a Unity scene by intuitively painting points into a scene achieved using ~~stolen faerie magic~~ GPU shader maths, rather than having to rely on 3D modeling and hand placing each object into the scene. I've attempted to recreate the method that I assume was used by the devs of Genshin Impact and significantly reduce the production time to create a high quality and interactive environment (interactive grass features to be added at a later update).

Currently this repository contains an entire Unity Project built in Unity 2019.4.11 LTS but in the future will be converted to a standard Unity Package.
