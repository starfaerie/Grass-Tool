This grass tool will allow environmental artists to procedurally add grass geometry to a Unity scene by intuitively painting points into a scene achieved using ~~witchcraft~~ GPU shader maths, rather than having to rely on 3D modeling and hand placing each object into the scene. I've attempted to recreate the method that I assume was used by the devs of Genshin Impact and significantly reduce the production time to create a high quality and interactive environment (interactive grass features to be added at a later update).
  
## Installation
##### As a Submodule _(recommended for easy versioning and future updates)_
 * In your git client, add Grass-Tool as a submodule at `.../Assets/Grass-Tool`
##### Direct Download (very much not recommended, but if you just wanna test it out right away without being able to download future updates from Unity I can't stop you...)
 * Click Clone or Download, then Download ZIP and put it in `.../Assets/Grass-Tool`
